# Zombies

Description
Welcome to Zombies, the ultimate test of your survival skills! In this intense game, your goal is to survive as long as possible against hordes of bloodthirsty zombies. Armed only with your trusty weapon, you must fend off a variety of zombie types that will appear randomly throughout the game.
With each new wave of zombies comes a greater challenge, as the undead become stronger, faster, and more numerous. You'll need to use all your combat skills to stay alive!
So grab your weapon and get ready to face the zombie apocalypseâ€¦Good luck!

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

Single player game, the player must be able to shoot (by click) and aim (by mouse) and combine them in order to kill all the zombies approaching.

When the left mouse button is pressed, the player's character will shoot a bullet in the direction they are currently facing. The player will need to aim using the mouse to make sure they hit their target.

## Backlog

- Create a loading screen, player rotation, zombies appear on screen
- Collision logic, zombies now appear randomly
- Sprites, background, gameover screen added
- Scoretable added, zombie waves logic implementation
- Audio implementation
